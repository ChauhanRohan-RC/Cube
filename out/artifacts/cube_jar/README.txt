=======================  Rubik's Cube Simulation and Solver  =======================
This is a 3D NxNxN Rubik's cube simulation and solver program. It supports any N-dimensional cube, with both Graphical and Command-Line control interfaces

## HOW TO RUN?
-> Install java on your computer and add it to PATH
-> Open cmd/terminal and run "java -jar cube.jar"

## MOVES NOTATION ----------------------------------------------

 U : Up
 R : Right
 F : Front
 D : Down
 L : Left
 B : Back

-> Moves are case insensitive
-> Add prime (') for anticlockwise move.
    ex R [clockwise] -> R' [anti-clockwise]
-> type move twice for a half turn (180 deg)
    ex R [single turn] -> RR [double turn]
-> To turn middle slice, add it's index in range [0, n-1] from the side of move
    ex 1. To turn 2nd slice from right -> R1
       2. To turn 4th slice from UP anticlockwise -> U'3
-> To turn multiple slices in a single move, type their indices in brackets separated by comma
    ex Turn 1st and 3rd slices from right in a 5*5 cube -> R[0,2]
