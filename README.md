## Features
* _Deep Neural Network_ (DNN) trained using _Stochastic Gradient Descent_ over millions of possible states. 
* Kociemba [2-Phase Algorithm](http://kociemba.org/math/imptwophase.htm) is used to generate on-the-fly data for training and testing
* Animated moves, Free and Clamped Camera modes in a 3D space, idle state levitation, stickers with lighting effects. 
* Immersive Ui and Command Line control

## Usage
* Install [Java](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/) on your computer and add it to the path 
* Clone this repository  
  `git clone https://github.com/ChauhanRohan-RC/Cube.git`
* Navigate to `out\artifacts\cube_jar` and run `launch.bat`.  
Optionally, open the terminal and run `java -jar cube.jar`

## Moves (Clockwise)
* U: Up 
* R: Right 
* F: Front 
* D: Down 
* L: Left 
* B: Back 

####
* Moves in the command line are case-insensitive
* Add prime ' for an anticlockwise move
  * `R` (clockwise) -> `R'` (anti-clockwise)
* Type the move character twice for a half turn (180 deg)
  * `R` (single turn) -> `RR` (double turn)
* To turn a middle slice, add it's index in range [0, n-1] from the side of move
  * `R1` :turns the 2nd slice from right face
  * `U'3` : turns the 4th slice from UP anticlockwise
* To turn multiple slices in a single move, type their indices in brackets separated by comma. 
  * `R[0,2]` : turns 1st and 3rd slices from the right face in clockwise direction
  * `F'[1,5,9]` : turns 2nd, 6th and 10th slices from the front face in anti-clockwise direction (for a cube with N > 9)
  * `UU[3,12]` : turns 4th and 13th slices from the top face 180Â° (for a cube with N > 12)


## Commands
* Enter a move sequence, with each move separated by space. For example
  * `f r u  r' u' f'`
  * `U FF b' L r f' bb F`
  * `U R' F[2,5] LL D B'[3,5]` 
* `n <dimension>` : sets the cube dimension 
* `scramble <moves>`: scramble the cube with given number of moves 
* `solve` : Solve the current state / Apply the generated solution
* `reset cube` : Reset the cube to starting cube
* `reset zoom` : Reset Ui zoom
* `undo` : undo the last move 
* `finish`: finish moves without animating
* `finish c`: cancel pending or currently animating moves
* `exit/quit`: quit
